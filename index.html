   <p>As we look back and count our blessings that the Lord has showered unto us over the years, we envision the future of the church.<br> <br>
   The church council is in the process of coming up with a four-year strategic plan that will cover a wholesome picture of our parish headquarter.<br> <br>
   Among other projects in the plan include the following: - <br> <br>
   a) Construction of modern washroom that is currently in the completion process. This is a project that will pass the test of time over many years to come. We are priviledged to witness it’s opening today. <br> <br>
   b) The Mother’s Union Department is working tirelessly towards developing rental units on their plot within vicinity of the church. <br><br>
   c) The church plans to complete the perimeter fence covering all her plots where the church sits.<br> <br>
   d) The church through the development committee, plans to have well set landscaping project to suit the image of a parish headquarter.<br> <br>
   e) Installation of extra screens to enhance the transmission of services with ease.<br> <br>
   f) KAMA department intends to improve the standard of the procession way to the main entrance of the church to suit all weather conditions. As a support to our young church, we intend to purchase various musical instruments for our Sunday School as well as improving their welfare through the purchase of various playing items.<br> <br>
   g) Planting of an extra church has always been a vision of this church in one of her plots, in a bid to bring closer the word of God to the people. This will be well laid in the strategic plan that will be ready towards the end of the year 2024.<br> <br>
   h) This strategic plan will be facilitated by you and me through our selfless giving to the work of our Lord. <br>
   <br>
   The principal goal for the church is the payment of quota which helps run the church activities throughout the year. The quota payment will never be a headache if we give our tithes honestly, remit our thanksgivings and give offertory with our clean hearts. This will give the church freedom of financing the above projects through the fundraiser by various departments across the year. </p>

    <h2>The Church History</h2>
    <h3><u>ACK ST. STEPHENS CHURCH JUJA FARM PARISH</u><br></h3>
    <h4>
    ACK ST. STEPHENS Juja farm is the mother church in ACK Juja farm parish. We take this opportunity to thank the Almighty God for His mercies and protection over this long journey that we celebrate today. The history of this church dates back in the year 1960 when the church was hosted by Juja farm primary school for a number of years. This was until the then directors of juja farm 1976 company allocated the church a plot where it sits today. Since inception,  the church has served under various parishes as listed below: <br>
    
    1. Thika parish<br>
    2. Kiamwangi parish<br>
    3. Juja parish<br>
    4. Thiririka parish <br>
    5. Juja farm parish <br>
    <hr>
    Through the commitment and resilience of members of the church then, the church organized a number of harambees to put up a permanent church. Though the church had very few members, many gave in kind and others labored to ensure that the church stands as it is today. Under the stewardship of the then Rev. Wilson Kinuthia, the ground breaking was done in the year 1994 and the permanent building started then. Before this period church was done by iron sheets where congregants worshipped for a number of years. 
    In the year 1997, the then bishop of Mt. Kenya south, the Rt Rev Peter Njenga laid the foundation stone of the church on 2nd March 1997 and named it ACK ST. STEPHENS CHURCH as per the request of the church members. Today, twenty-seven years later we celebrate many blessings from God as a church. The church has been served by various vicars among them.<br>
    1. Rev Wilson Kinuthia-1988<br>

    Due to long distances travelled by some Christians to attend services, ACK ST. Stephens later spread to other areas in the parish and planted other churches with the first. being Karima Simba in 1997, ACK Gikumari (now a parish), ACK Juja house, ACK Mountain view, ACK Mwireri and Salama church (now a parish). Juja farm churches were given a parish status in the year 2000 under the then Rev Beauter Kamau under the name Thiririka Parish. In the year 2002, under the request of the church council, the then Bishop Rt Rev Gideon Githiga changed the name of the parish to ACK Juja Farm Parish The church has carried out various development projects among them <br>
    a. Planting of other churches as mentioned above and as the mother church ensuring that they stand on their feet to operate independently <br>
    b. Mothers union have managed to buy a plot which they intend to develop to an income earning status. They also have been able to construct a modern kitchen which is used for various church occasions as the one we have today<br> c. The church now sits on four plots totaling to an acre whereby the extra plots have been purchased by generous contributions of the Christians through various departmental fundraisers.<br>
    d. The church has constructed a vicarage which is now rented out and thus an income generating project<br>
    e. The church constructed two standard classrooms and bought a van. The school project was run for two years and later suspended to enable the church lay strong foundations and fundamentals before another reopening. The classrooms are currently in use by our teens and Sunday school and for various meetings including at the parish level.<br>
    f. The church has greatly improved the praise and worship instruments by modernizing the keyboard, microphones and installation of screens to enhance transmission of services.<br>
    During this period, the church has had many church councils lead by various vice chairmen among them the late Elijah Kamau, the Late David Gikuma and currently Moses Kaniaru. It has not been a smooth journey but God has been on our side. We sincerely thank you, Christians in this great church for your continued support of the church through various departments. Your commitment, your tireless giving to the lord, your prayers are not taken for granted. may our lord bless you all and bless ACK St. Stephens church and our entire Juja farm parish.  In light of all above, we thank all for your immeasurable support towards these projects which continues to define the image of ACK. St. Stephen Juja farm parish. As we look back and count our blessings that the Lord has showered unto us over the years, we envision the future of the church. The church council is in the process of coming up with a four-year strategic plan that will cover a wholesome picture of our parish headquarter.

    <p>Our KAMA projects include:</p>
    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="section-header">Church Growth Initiatives</h3>
      <p>Efforts to increase outreach and spread the gospel more widely.<br>
      c) The church plans to complete the perimeter fence covering all her plots where the church sits.<br>
d) The church through the development committee, plans to have well set landscaping project to suit the image of a parish headquarter.<br>
e) Installation of extra screens to enhance the transmission of services with ease.<br>
f) KAMA department intends to improve the standard of the procession way to the main entrance of the church to suit all weather conditions. As a support to our young church, we intend to purchase various musical instruments for our Sunday School as well as improving their welfare through the purchase of various playing items.<br>
g) Planting of an extra church has always been a vision of this church in one of her plots, in a bid to bring closer the word of God to the people. This will be well laid in the strategic plan that will be ready towards the end of the year 2024.<br>
h) This strategic plan will be facilitated by you and me through our selfless giving to the work of our Lord. The principal goal for the church is the payment of quota which helps run the church activities throughout the year. The quota payment will never be a headache if we give our tithes honestly, remit our thanksgivings and give offertory with our clean hearts. This will give the church freedom of financing the above projects through the fundraiser by various departments across the year.</p>
